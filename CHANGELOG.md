# Changelog

## dev

* Update plugin in order to work with the new Python implementation of RetDec scripts.
* Fix: Terminate spawned decompilation process when IDA is closed or a new decompilation is triggered ([#20](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/issues/20)).

## v0.5 (June 7, 2018)

* Added support for IDA 7.x ([#2](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/issues/2)). Dropped support for IDA 6.x.
* Removed remote decompilation through RetDec's API ([#9](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/issues/9), [#13](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/issues/13)).
* Fix: `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is now used instead of `#!/bin/bash` to run the scripts ([avast-tl/retdec #258](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec/issues/258)).
* Fix: Allow decompilation of input files with `f_LOADER` file type ([#3](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec-idaplugin/issues/3)).

## v0.4 (December 14, 2017)

* Added support for local decompilations. Requires locally installed [RetDec](https://github.com/avast-tl/retdec).

## v0.3.1 (September 7, 2016)

* Fixed searching for the input file in cases when the `.idb` file was moved.
* The plugin now creates its temporary files in the directory with the `.idb` file, not in the directory with the input file.

## v0.3 (August 22, 2016)

* Added support for decompilation of COFF object files.
* Added support for decompilation of Intel HEX files.
* Added support for decompilation of files containing just raw machine code.
* Added generation of IDA comments into C files generated by full decompilation.
* The plugin no longer performs automatic decompilation of the opened file upon the start of IDA.
* The plugin no longer ignores statically linked functions when selective decompilation is invoked through IDA.
* The plugin does not allow decompilation of non-existing files like objects extracted from archives.
* The plugin does not allow decompilations that it cannot properly handle.

## v0.2 (January 26, 2016)

* Added an automatic check whether a newer version of the plugin is available. When a newer version exists, the user is prompted to download and install the latest version.
* The output from full decompilations is no longer syntax-highlighted with IDA's color tags.
* Several bug fixes.

## v0.1.1 (November 25, 2015)
